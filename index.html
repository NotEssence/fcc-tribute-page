            Norman Ernest Borlaug (1914 â€“ September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist who led initiatives
            worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the
            Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, 
            the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.

            Borlaug was often called "the father of the Green Revolution", and is credited with saving over a 
            billion people worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the 
            president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 
            1997 article "Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture 
            that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths." He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 
            in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.
